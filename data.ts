      "One of the key breakthroughs in China's rural revitalization strategy lies in advancing arts education at the level of basic rural schooling—promoting educational equity between urban and rural areas while strengthening rural cultural governance. Every summer, the art co-creation platform Let Summer Be invites talented and socially engaged young artists to reside in rural schools across China. By transforming artists into teaching artists, the program uses collaborative art-making to cultivate children's enthusiasm for knowledge and for life itself in mountainous regions.",
      "Recently, the documentary Paradise, How Far?, directed by Yuan Jinxin, was shortlisted for New Weekly's 'Hot Sound' Nonfiction Short Film Award. The film documents Let Summer Be's rural arts-education practice in 2022. Compared with traditional public-interest short films, Paradise, How Far? adopts an observational perspective that focuses on the meeting of two experiential worlds—from the hidden pain embedded in the growth of left-behind children in mountainous areas to the multiple constraints shaping the survival and development of marginal rural communities. Individuals, families, villages, and regions gradually connect from isolated points into visible lines, while a young grassroots arts-education collective reflects, through practice, on the boundaries of action and the directions forward. In this week's retrospective, we begin with the documentary and invite participants to share the thinking behind their work.",
      "In the summer of 2022, just before departure, documentary director Yuan Jinxin asked me, 'Do you want this to be a promotional film for Let Summer Be, or a work of my own observation and reflection?' I answered without hesitation: the latter. Paradise, How Far? honestly records the dilemmas a grassroots organization encounters while working in mountainous regions.",
      "In August 2023, Paradise, How Far? reached its tenth screening—this time for the very children who appeared in the film. Their villages were scattered across a ten-kilometer radius, and parents rode motorcycles to bring their children to an outdoor basketball court for the screening. Due to a projector malfunction, dozens of children ultimately gathered around a single 13-inch laptop and watched the entire film attentively. Many said it was the first screening they had ever attended.",
      "As with screenings held in urban cultural spaces, we held a post-screening discussion with the children and their parents. Unlike urban audiences, they did not raise questions shaped by social-science critique. As the filmed subjects themselves, their responses were simple and direct: 'Did you like seeing yourself from last year?' 'Yes!' 'Do you want us to come back every year to make documentaries?' 'Yes!' For arts-education practitioners, these brief exchanges were deeply significant.",
      "Increasingly, social scientists have begun to recognize the risk that 'mutual visibility' in fieldwork or action-based research can slip into one-sided gazes. The same applies to public-interest work. When engaging with those one seeks to support, the posture of action requires constant reflection and care. Yet fear of imposing one's gaze should not become a reason to abandon action altogether.",
      "Geographic mobility alone does not dissolve the cultural barriers between urban and rural life. By the second quarter of 2023, Yunnan Province had over 6.7 million rural migrant workers employed outside their home regions. Beyond tourist imagery, the daily lives of multiethnic rural communities remain largely unknown. Even amid an overflow of short-form video content, people remain confined within their own information bubbles.",
      "In 2021, due to the pandemic, I was unable to return to school and, by chance, became a semester-long mathematics teacher at a rural elementary school near the China–Myanmar border in Yunnan. There, I witnessed firsthand the realities of mountain schools: severe structural shortages of teachers, performative administrative management, the absence of school nurses, imbalanced curricula, high dropout rates in middle school, and persistent school bullying. These were never merely educational problems. The same educational policies and resources, when applied to different families, produced vastly different outcomes.",
      "In public discourse, 'arts education' is often equated with art instruction and easily misunderstood as a one-way transmission of artists' ideas to rural children. In practice, however, meaningful arts education gently confronts urgent social and educational issues. Before designing any curriculum, the team conducts semi-structured interviews, examining four developmental dimensions: students' interests and hobbies; personality traits and mental health; social behavior; and external environments, particularly educational practices within schools and families, as well as broader policy contexts. These insights inform both course structure and teaching methods.",
      "During one interview, we visited the home of a sixth-grade girl, Xiaopeng. The walls were covered with academic award certificates earned by her and her younger brother during primary school. Yet Xiaopeng's outward demeanor did not align with urban expectations of a 'model student.' She explained that at school, she and her classmates were all in a state of 'going dark,' because teachers were extremely harsh. Homework was overwhelming, and corporal punishment was common.",
      "'Going dark' was a term the students invented to describe sudden, exaggerated, almost manic performances without clear cause. Only after leaving school did they stop 'going dark.' It was a form of black humor learned unconsciously among peers.",
      "Educational challenges did not end at the school gate. For children born after 2010, short-video apps function much like QQ or WeChat did for earlier generations—as social platforms. At the same time, they circulate large volumes of adult and violent content. Children lack the ability to discern such information, while parents and teachers often lack awareness or intervention strategies. In daily debriefs conducted by Let Summer Be's anthropology research team, many children reported being victims of school bullying and choosing silence most of the time.",
      "After discussion, we decided to create a drama workshop centered on practicing how to say 'no.' Through role-play, drama teachers and students jointly imagined potential crisis scenarios from daily life, encouraging children to assert boundaries and speak up against behaviors that made them uncomfortable.",
      "Educational practice is always deeply grounded in reality, especially in culturally diverse mountain villages. As outside practitioners, negotiating a shared understanding of arts education with local stakeholders—students, parents, and village committees—is essential to ensuring feasibility and effectiveness.",
      "Most local communities warmly welcome volunteer teachers, but a small number of parents or village officials may not fully understand or support such initiatives. In previous years, some parents even tore up their children's artwork, criticizing them for 'scribbling instead of studying Chinese and math.' We realized that limiting arts education to collaboration with children alone could unintentionally deepen rifts between children and their families or surroundings.",
      "As a result, we launched community-based art projects that invited other community members to witness outcomes and participate. In 2022, for example, clown parade designer Alice led children from the clown workshop to don red noses and walk through markets, along the Nu River, and into the mountains, playing games with villagers. Seeing familiar children reappear as clowns—speaking in their own voices and doing what they found joyful—villagers experienced a kind of re-recognition. The red nose became a small magic wand, allowing everyone to meet one another anew.",
      "On the day of the final course presentation in 2023, the local basketball team unexpectedly needed the performance space. Worried about occupying a public area, we urged one another to wrap up quickly. Yet halfway through the performance, a village leader surprised us by saying, 'It's fine—go on. We'll wait.' Members of the basketball team stopped to watch attentively. After so many earlier obstacles, this moment felt profoundly affirming.",
      "A recurring question we face is whether a single summer can truly make a difference. This is also a form of self-critique among organizers who run arts-education programs in their spare time: how do we avoid becoming experience-driven, pop-up summer camps?",
      "China has no shortage of teaching-support programs—undergraduates seeking credits, study-abroad agencies enhancing student profiles, urban–rural exchange initiatives. These efforts represent difficult first steps; offering mutual recognition is always meaningful. Yet we choose summer not for convenience, but because we recognize that semester-based instruction allows little freedom for action. Volunteers' values often diverge from quantitative metrics imposed by education authorities. More importantly, we refuse to arrive like meteors and leave just as quickly. We aim instead to build long-term trust and cooperation with local communities, accompanying children's growth through sustained, year-by-year engagement."

      "In my view, Chen Jiaping's documentary Paradise, How Far? is grounded in a parrot-like mode of lyricism—being present, watching, recording, and reproducing.",
      "On October 30, 2022, director Gu Tao hosted a screening of Paradise, How Far?",
      "A parrot is an animal that spends its entire life mimicking human speech, yet can never truly express emotion through language. Its body becomes an objective vessel, storing the sounds it hears in an inner chamber of memory. While the people in a household move steadily toward tomorrow, the parrot, often inadvertently, begins to recite voices from yesterday—voices long forgotten. Within four walls, echoes of the past linger, reverberating until the parrot's death.",
      "In my view, Paradise, How Far? is built upon precisely this kind of parrot-like lyricism: presence, observation, recording, reenactment. Chen Jiaping, though a direct participant in all that unfolds, presents himself only through the silence of a bystander. Upon this carefully constructed silence arise other sounds: the grief-stricken singing at poet Hu Xudong's funeral; the choked speech at his friend Kun Niao's wedding; his wife's relentless reproaches in a car at midnight; the anxious counsel of his aging father. Like all poets, Chen Jiaping longs for 'the stillness of the open wilderness,' yet he understands all too clearly that 'his life is not a life lived alone.' His life is the sum of the lives of those he loves. Within this helpless yet tender cacophony, he chooses to become an 'unfeeling' parrot—silently remembering an affectionate life. And yet, this does not prevent him, beyond the parrot's narration, from yearning for a voice that is truly his own: the poet's voice.",
      "At the beginning of the film, Chen Jiaping washes up in a bathroom. A broadcast commemorating the centenary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party blends seamlessly with the sound of running water—an utterly mundane fusion, yet one that inevitably produces an inner dissonance. The broadcast serves as a conduit for an official, grand narrative, diffusing a set of words entirely detached from everyday life into its smallest details. Against this generational background noise, Chen Jiaping opens the tap, allowing the ordinary, flowing moments of life of poets born in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s to surface before the audience.",
      "Throughout the film, Chen Jiaping places himself deliberately low within the crowd. He admits that his interactions with poets such as Ma Yan (1979–2010) and Ma Hua (1972–2004) were not particularly close—merely sharing the same office air. Yet he preserves, intact in memory, that shared breath, carrying it across time to present it once more to the viewer. We are fortunate to see archival footage of Ma Yan speaking while alive. But this nested cinematography constantly reminds us that the poet's image has already been sealed into historical record. Even more poignant is the moment when the camera turns to poet Hu Xudong (1974–2021): the director draws us back into a first-person perspective, listening to a young 'Hu Zi' passionately analyzing Ma Yan's poetic structure in Chongqing dialect, as though he were still here before us, speaking to us directly.",
      "If mourning the dead is painful, then what is even more desolate is watching the dead mourn the dead from the vantage point of the future. At Ma Yan's funeral, Hu Xudong asked friends from all walks of life to write postcards—Ma Yan's favorite—for her. Yet in August 2021, Hu Xudong himself died suddenly from an epileptic seizure, and we found ourselves again at a funeral, singing him farewell: 'Weiming Lake is an ocean / Poets hide beneath its surface / Souls are all fish / Rising now and then to the light'",
      "Poets—though you have already journeyed to a more beautiful paradise, why do I still feel that you remain among us? Perhaps you are only hidden beneath the water's surface. Your undying poetry tethers your undying souls, surging again and again into our lives, into our hearts.",
      "On the other side of the screen, I could barely hold back my tears. Chen Jiaping, however, stood apart from the crowd, gazing at the camera in silence. To continue filming even during mourning should not be hastily interpreted as emotional detachment. Chen is pursuing a form of witnessing and participation imbued with historical weight. The cost is an objective lens that forever stands between him and what he sees. Such a commitment to remembrance and responsibility is, for an ordinary person immersed in grief, both heavy and cruel. Thus, beyond public mourning, he also seeks out narrow corners in which to retreat into private reflection and emotion. As the car disappears into a stormy night, his emotions surge quietly beneath the music.",
      "At the wedding of Kun Niao, a poet born in the 1980s, I saw him awkwardly encased in a suit. Half-jokingly, he commanded the audience: 'You must bless me—I have no choice.' Why must there be blessings? Why is there no choice? His speech did not celebrate a shared love, but reaffirmed the predicament of an individual. The absence of family weighed heavily on him; family, it seemed, were the roots of life, while friends were gifts gathered during the body's wandering. 'I'm already very satisfied—I've done everything I wanted to do,' he said. For many, a wedding signifies less the beginning of a new life than the ritualized end of an old one. He had once 'lived in this place in a way that was out of tune'—would marriage bring that dissonance to an end? As he stepped into this sacred space, the wind swept across his hair, covering one eye; the other reddened. The poet cried, without leaning toward the bride.",
      "Chen Jiaping once had an accident while filming as he drove. Later, his wife reproached him for filming, while he remained silent, eyes fixed on the camera. Between cinéma vérité and direct cinema, Chen chooses the former, acknowledging that in certain moments he amplifies the camera's presence, using its burden as a means to further dissect reality. In the scene of his wife's reproach, the camera's presence honestly reflects the power dynamics between husband and wife in that moment—he is always listening, always watching.",
      "City neon lights wash over Chen's face; fireworks burst overhead; from above, an empty lot appears—nearly desolate. Along an endless coastline, from below, a full moon rises—distant yet bright. Carrying all his memories, he returns to his 'cell,' only now without an 'iris' to carry him aloft.",
      "Yes—the parrot has died. The parrot that participated alongside Chen Jiaping throughout the film died in the middle of the night. But I believe that the poet Chen Jiaping still holds onto the ideal of the 'iris,' only buried deeper. In the black frames at the beginning and end of the film, the poet discards the parrot-like images of record. What remains is only his poetic monologue, spoken in his native accent. Poetry may be the only way, under the arrangements of our time, for us to arrive at 'a life of one's own.'",
      "I do not know what the parrot's death ultimately signifies for Chen Jiaping. I only see that as his wife and daughter weep, Chen once again takes out his phone. Perhaps he understands better than anyone that mourning is everywhere, permeating every night of life. We will all eventually fall asleep in the dark of mourning, tears still wet—and when you wake—dawn is still smiling.",

      "Tomorrow marks the 23rd anniversary of 'Rose Boy.' On April 20, 2000, Ye Yongzhi, a 15-year-old middle-school student in Pingtung County, Taiwan, was found dead in a school restroom. During his life, Ye Yongzhi—assigned male at birth—was persistently subjected to school bullying and online abuse because his mannerisms were considered feminine. In 2018, singer Jolin Tsai released the song 'Womxnly / Rose Boy' in his memory, while also expressing support for gender-fluid individuals still fighting for social equality. Since then, April 20 has come to be known as 'Rose Boy Memorial Day.'",
      "Although more people are choosing to stand with the LGBTQ community, the fate of the 'Rose Boy' continues to be replayed across the world. According to data released in 2022 by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, as many as 82% of transgender people have experienced suicidal ideation; at least 40% have attempted suicide. Among all age groups, adolescents account for the highest proportion.",
      "The protagonist of this article, Xiong Shin (a pseudonym), is a transgender man born in 2001 (assigned female at birth, but identifying as male). At age 14, Xiong moved from China to attend a boarding high school in the New England region of the northeastern United States. That same year, his close friend and senior, Emelia, died by hanging herself from a tree on a hill behind the school. Emelia was a transgender woman who had already come out and was living openly as female. Local media coverage of her death, though filled with grief and lamentation, revealed a profound lack of understanding and respect for transgender people in its headline: 'The high school junior killed himself.'",
      "What happened to Emelia made Xiong feel that the suffocating social prejudices faced by the living show an 'equal' cruelty toward the dead as well: 'You are killed by the very thing you oppose—and buried by it too.'",
      "At 18, Xiong underwent a series of gender-affirming surgeries in both China and the United States, and legally changed the gender marker on his ID to male. Yet access to transgender medical care is extremely limited worldwide. Someone like Xiong, who was able to complete surgery relatively smoothly, could be considered 'lucky.' When he first received the interview invitation, he felt he was not the most representative subject and suggested interviewing queer friends with fewer 'privileges' instead: 'I don't really want to use the word privilege—so-called privilege is really just the rights I should have as a human being.'",
      "In the end, he decided to tell his story anyway. Through this 'lucky' experience, he hopes to show that speaking out alone is not enough. As long as so-called 'marginalized groups' have not gained equal access to social resources, and as long as the public lacks sufficient understanding and channels of knowledge about them, the tragedy of the 'Rose Boy' will continue to repeat itself. What follows is Xiong Shin's personal account.",
      "Many people ask me, 'When did you first realize you were a boy?' That question doesn't really apply to me. I believe people themselves do not inherently have gender; rather, gender is assigned through socialization. Since we live in a gendered society, I choose the gender identity that aligns most closely with my inner sense of self. So 'realizing I was a boy' was a gradual process with no precise moment.",
      "From a young age, I liked imitating boys' behaviors. I studied how men walked, mimicked their posture, carried things for my mother like a gentleman, and held doors open for girls. If a girl held the door for me, I would feel distressed, thinking I wasn't 'man enough.' Although I later realized these behaviors reinforced masculine stereotypes, at the time I didn't yet understand what 'being male' meant to me. I could only explore my gender by imitating socially expected male images.",
      "After entering puberty at 13, my gender dysphoria (GD)—the distress caused by a mismatch between one's assigned sex and gender identity—intensified. A person with gender dysphoria does not necessarily feel discomfort with their entire body; the anxiety may focus on specific parts. For me, breast development was especially distressing. To make my chest less noticeable, I wore tight compression sports bras every day. I had a gradient-colored polo shirt I loved—the darker top and lighter bottom made my chest less visible, helping me feel more 'passing' (a term in transgender contexts meaning one's appearance is perceived as cisgender).",
      "Public restrooms were another struggle. For most people, using a restroom requires no thought: men go to men's rooms, women to women's. Before my medical transition, every restroom sign forced me into a dilemma between following my internal identity and conforming to external social rules. Which restroom I chose depended on how 'passing' I felt that day.",
      "Emotionally, I wanted to use the men's restroom. Once, in a mall, I went into one without stalls. When another man walked in and saw me, I felt exposed and deeply uncomfortable. Still, despite the risk of being discovered, I felt even more unwilling to use the women's restroom against my conscience.",
      "I attended a boarding high school in New England. I once discussed pronouns with a new Spanish classmate. She said people could use whichever pronouns they preferred. I asked, almost impulsively, 'Could you use he/him for me?' She agreed naturally. When people actually began referring to me as he/him, it felt much more comfortable than she/her. It wasn't a revolutionary act—more a 'why not?' moment—but I was still nervous, feeling as though I was cautiously testing the edge of danger, wondering if the change was too sudden or radical.",
      "Some people ask whether exposure to more transgender information in the U.S. influenced my decision to pursue surgery. My mother asked the same: 'Did America change you?' My answer is no. Gender dysphoria is primarily physiological, not social. Even without exposure to any related information while growing up, I would still be a transgender man, and I would still try to make my appearance more masculine. On the contrary, lacking access to information would only have made me more depressed.",
      "Questions like these reveal that many people still see transgender identity as something 'foreign,' shaped by social circles or environments. Yet transgender people have existed in every society throughout history, understood differently across cultures. No matter where I grew up, the fact that I am transgender would not change.",
      "At my high school, a particularly attentive school counselor noticed my masculine clothing and introduced me to Emelia, a senior transgender student. She had already come out at school and was supported by most students and teachers; she was also well-liked. She told me she was considering whether to start wearing makeup. I was thrilled and encouraged her to trust her instincts.",
      "Her death came suddenly. One weekend she invited me to hear her band perform. She sang 'Gimme Some Lovin'' by the Spencer Davis Group, and her voice was beautiful. The next day, she was supposed to attend a sports event at 3 p.m., but never showed up. At 5 p.m., someone found her body hanging from a tree behind the school.",
      "I was studying when two older students burst in and said jokingly, 'Someone hung themselves from a tree in the school yard—guess who.' I couldn't believe it and was irritated by their tone. They hinted it was an upperclassman. A sudden intuition struck me: 'Could it be Emelia?' About two hours later, the school announced a memorial service in the chapel.",
      "On the way there, a voice kept telling me: it can't be her. But when I entered the chapel and saw it filled with students and teachers, the principal confirmed the news of Emelia's suicide.",
      "Across the crowd, a senior I knew from math class looked at me with red eyes. When our eyes met, I broke down. I cried for the entire hour of the memorial. The feeling was unbearable—you meet someone wonderful, someone you might have become best friends with if there had been time, and suddenly they are gone.",
      "For the next two weeks, I collapsed emotionally, crying constantly—not only mourning her death, but blaming myself for not noticing her distress sooner. Just weeks before, Emelia had delivered a powerful coming-out speech to the whole school: 'I am transgender. I puzzle every day about why I came out a boy… If everything goes to plan, I'll look very different in a couple of years.'",
      "Everyone was shocked because Emelia had already decided to begin hormone therapy the following March. No one expected her to leave in December. For those with gender dysphoria, surgery can feel like the 'gate to heaven'—a new life on the other side. She had reached that gate through her own effort. Why did she choose to leave?",
      "Later we learned she had hidden the rope under her dorm bed long before.",
      "During her life, Emelia had hoped to move from the boys' dorm to the girls' dorm. Several girls volunteered to room with her. She also requested gender-neutral uniforms, since the school's dress code was highly gendered. But until her death, the school—concerned about parental and donor objections—rejected every request for substantive change.",
      "After Emelia's death, someone told me she killed herself because she was transgender, and hoped I, as another trans person, wouldn't be too affected. But my empathy for her didn't come from our shared identity—it came from one human grieving another. To me, she was simply a person. We shouldn't automatically link her suicide to her transgender identity without evidence.",
      "These reactions made me realize that while someone is alive, outsiders cannot carry their struggles through empathy; and after death, discrimination doesn't necessarily lessen. At least the local media reported: 'The high school junior killed himself after revealing he was transitioning to become a female.'",
      "From age 17, I began considering gender-affirming surgery.",
      "After Emelia's death, I was the only trans student at school. For four years, I applied annually to move from the girls' dorm to the boys' dorm, but was always denied. The school offered monthly counseling sessions, which mostly involved listening. Many students avoided counseling altogether, fearing their issues would be reported to administrators.",
      "What I really needed wasn't therapy, but clear information about medical transition. No one told me what steps to take or where to go. I learned online that medical transition requires seeing an endocrinologist, obtaining a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, and then accessing hormone therapy or surgery.",
      "In my junior year, I traveled alone from Connecticut to New York to see an endocrinologist. As a minor, I needed parental consent. My parents required diagnoses from four doctors. Over two years, I had eight consultations. Each time, I repeated my symptoms, and rarely received useful guidance.",
      "The process was contradictory. To transition from female to male, I had to prove I was 'male' by performing stereotypical masculinity. When I said I liked drawing, a doctor responded, 'Only girls like drawing.' To get diagnosed, I learned to perform basketball, video games—whatever fit their biases.",
      "At the same time, doctors expected visible suffering from dysphoria—but if I was diagnosed with a mental illness, I would be barred from surgery. In other words, to qualify, I had to be dysphoric but mentally healthy, masculine but not unstable.",
      "Even now, two years after surgery, I find this deeply unjust. Having others judge your gender based on behavior feels humiliating.",
      "Yet this is the path transgender people must take in both China and the U.S.",
      "What I truly needed was information—what hormone injections involve, what life after surgery is like. From this perspective, the Informed Consent Model makes more sense: doctors provide comprehensive information and leave the decision to the patient.",
      "After receiving my diagnosis, I began medical transition. Trans men who pursue transition must inject testosterone every two weeks or monthly. Many learn to self-inject. I learned at a clinic, then injected myself at home. Some fear needles or lack access and resort to homemade topical treatments.",
      "I completed top surgery in the U.S. Recovery required weeks in bed. The cost was enormous. After graduation, I took a gap year and returned to China for bottom surgery.",
      "Even then, time and money remain barriers. I first visited Peking Union Medical College Hospital, then was referred multiple times. Each consultation, document, and appointment cost hundreds of yuan. Before surgery, I had already spent thousands.",
      "More importantly, under heteronormative cultural dominance, the medical system constantly reminds you that being transgender is 'wrong.'",
      "Post-surgery, I still faced humiliation. At a gynecology follow-up, the sign read 'Men Forbidden.' Despite my legal gender marker being male, nurses repeatedly questioned me: 'If you're male, why are you here?'",
      "Whether Emelia, who died before surgery, or I, who completed it, both endured indescribable pain. The difference is that today, I no longer cling to rigid definitions of 'male' or 'female.' I'm drawn to those who challenge the binary—boys in skirts, girls with strong muscles—because they are beautiful.",
      "My only regret is that despite all I've learned, I still think of that afternoon seven years ago, of my 14-year-old self failing to support my senior enough. I cannot fully explain her death, nor find an answer.",
      "At the interviewee's request, Xiong Shin is a pseudonym."

      "Perhaps we can return to July 2022 and revisit a perspective proposed by the directing duo the Daniels. At the time, Daniel Kwan told the news-blog site Mashable: 'I think that's the version of post-postmodernism that we're hunting for—that metamodernism.'",
      "The term 'metamodernism' was coined in 1975 by Mas'ud Zavarzadeh, a professor of critical theory at the State University of New York. In the post–World War II period, skeptical discourses and social disorder kept emerging worldwide, and Zavarzadeh argued that reconciling opposing concepts—'hope' with 'doubt,' 'construction' with 'destruction,' 'positivity' with 'negativity'—could keep us from sliding into the extreme of self-annihilation. Still, metamodernism did not truly gain currency until the early 21st century. In 2010, Dutch scholars Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin v.d. Akker, in Notes on Metamodernism, responded to newly intensifying global crises—climate change, financial collapse, political turbulence, and the digital revolution—by summarizing 'the metamodern sensibility' as an informed naïveté, a pragmatic idealism.",
      "In an era when everyone is constantly being pulled into a vortex of information, perhaps this is precisely a time that more urgently needs metamodernism as consolation. The Daniels' cleverness lies in noticing this—and rendering it cinematically.",
      "Let's return to the film itself. In the face of an absurd reality, contemporary people often gravitate toward a nihilism and decadent spirit like that of the antagonist Jobu Tupaki—protecting the self by denying all meaning, value, and morality.",
      "Through the character Evelyn, however, the Daniels interpret a way of living under a metamodern worldview: for an individual, we must, on the basis of a fuller understanding of the world's complexity, allow sincerity and irony to coexist, so that we can live more calmly amid the world's multiplicity and intricacy.",
      "In *Everything Everywhere All at Once*, a range of familiar problems within American society—racism, homophobia, fatphobia, tax stress, midlife divorce crises, teenage rebellion, gun violence, and more—are all mentioned. Yet the filmmakers' intention is not to deeply depict or investigate any single social issue in isolation. Instead, they treat these issues as a chaotic whole, placing Evelyn inside an oppressive metamodern life.",
      "To emphasize how political pressures permeate Evelyn's existence, the directors create the 'verse-jumping' premise, simulating—and reproducing—the confusion, helplessness, even psychic disorientation of living in a digital world where one must process multiple streams of information simultaneously. As the English title puts it: everything, everywhere, all at once, rushing toward her from every direction.",
      "In the first half of the film, Evelyn is tasked with traveling across multiple universes to defeat an enemy. Exhausted, overwhelmed, and stretched thin, she also catches glimpses of other possibilities—and unsurprisingly begins to envy the 'better answers' that life might have offered, such as becoming a red-carpet movie star instead of marrying the seemingly unaccomplished Waymond.",
      "If the story continued along that path, it would become indistinguishable from the multiverse franchises popular in recent Marvel and DC films (such as *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse*). Traditional superhero multiverse narratives usually fall into two patterns. One resembles the Spider-Man series: an ordinary person torn between two lives, repeatedly hesitating and bouncing between them, eventually facing the pain of opportunity costs. The other resembles *X-Men: Days of Future Past* or *Avengers: Endgame*: heroes abandon an ideal present, return to the past, and create a better future for the larger world.",
      "Both patterns ultimately amplify a tragic ethos of sacrificing the self to fulfill the greater good. Although these films may look more overtly 'sci-fi' than *Everything Everywhere All at Once*, with grander worldbuilding, the philosophical question they keep rehearsing through the multiverse is essentially the same: if reality could be replayed, would another choice have been better?",
      "Yet the Daniels do not, like Doctor Strange in *Avengers*, believe that among countless parallel universes there exists a single 'optimal solution.' Kwan stated bluntly: 'I don't care about multiverse movies.' His partner Daniel Scheinert proposed a postmodern premise: 'What if we made a multiverse movie, and after exploring infinite universes, the conclusion was: nothing matters—what would happen?'",
      "In the Alpha universe, Evelyn's image switches from movie star to animated character, as if we are being swept along by endlessly bouncing information on our phone screens. 'We were trying to use the multiverse as a proxy for the internet,' Kwan explained in an interview with Deadline.",
      "We might even imagine each universe as what science-fiction writer Ted Chiang called, in February of this year when commenting on ChatGPT, 'a blurry JPEG of the web.' We browse compressed fragments across different JPEGs inside GPT much as Evelyn leaps across countless universes without being able to examine or linger in any one of them. The film never directly mentions the internet or AI, but their influence hangs over every character like a ghost, creating a postmodern sense of disorder, chaos, and emptiness.",
      "Confronted with this condition, the Daniels use two highly playful images to represent two sharply opposed strategies embodied by the characters: the everything bagel and googly eyes.",
      "Through Jobu, the film explains how the bagel—an extremely ordinary, trendy everyday food—forms a clever analogy with the most serious philosophical question of all: the absurdity of existence. Jobu: 'All my hopes and dreams, my old report cards, every breed of dog, every Craigslist collectible, sesame, poppy seeds, salt—it all collapses in on itself. Because you see, when you really put everything on a bagel, it reveals… this truth.'",
      "With a name 'Jobu' that is the meaningless opposite of 'Joy,' she turns toward a Nietzschean nihilism and self-destruction. On the surface, Jobu is murdering people across the multiverse; in essence, she is negating all meaning, value, and morality. Her decadent spirit echoes the popular cynicism of our time—the pervasive refrain that 'life isn't worth it.' At the center of the bagel's dark closed loop lies the void of existence. Evelyn: 'What truth?' Jobu: 'Nothing matters.'",
      "Rather than having Evelyn's father-in-law 'solve' the bagel crisis through patriarchal violence by shooting his granddaughter, the Daniels choose to have Evelyn place googly eyes on the center of her forehead—embracing, and dissolving, the emptiness represented by the bagel.",
      "If we only read the googly eyes at the surface level of plot, then when Evelyn sticks a 'third eye' on her forehead, gains superpowers, and saves every universe, googly eyes could easily be reduced to a magical object dropped from the sky.",
      "But the googly eyes are not a random whim. They should not be read in isolation; they must be understood together with the bagel. Visually, the bagel and googly eyes form a Daoist yin–yang pattern: the black outside and white inside of the bagel stands for yin, or negativity, which must be complemented by the white outside and black inside of the googly eyes—yang, or positivity—so balance can be achieved.",
      "It is not the act of putting on googly eyes itself that grants Evelyn power. Rather, it is the transcendent conversation after she and her daughter become stones that allows Evelyn to stand at a higher vantage point and see the whole. After understanding her daughter's nihilism, she places googly eyes on her forehead, echoing the 'third eye of wisdom' found in figures like Erlang Shen in *In Search of the Supernatural*, or in Hindu-Buddhist imagery. Once this eye opens a path toward awakening, Evelyn learns to reconcile with everything in the secular world—including her daughter.",
      "The Daniels are not the only creators to use googly eyes in art. As early as 2011, the British artist Andy Holden—described by critics as one of the pioneers of metamodernist art—used googly eyes in *Eyes in Space*, sticking them onto a photograph of Earth taken after Apollo 17 landed on the moon in 1972, prompting viewers to look back at themselves from outer space and liberate themselves from the trivialities of daily life or political entanglements on Earth.",
      "The scene in the film where two stones converse on a cliff also seems to echo Holden's other installation work *Pyramid Piece*: the artist hides speakers inside stones so that, as viewers walk through the gallery, they hear some stones asking questions and others answering, together producing an illusory sense of existence.",
      "The Daniels' use of irony is not new. After all, since the 1970s, a series of kung fu films made in the United States have achieved broad success and recognition in the West through humorous visuals. But Kwan has said: 'If we just made a fun action movie, we wouldn't be happy; if we just wrote a philosophy paper (inside the film), we wouldn't be happy either.'",
      "What Kwan and Scheinert pursue is precisely the fusion of the two: while expanding the intellectual scope that earlier Chinese diasporic kung fu films touched upon, they also encourage solemn philosophical cinema to become bolder in its creative methods.",
      "For the Daniels, one manifestation of 'sincere irony' is this: while other creators still tread cautiously along the edges of American political correctness, they offer a creative response to the spectrum of political correctness itself. They are not afraid to reproduce real-world stereotypes in the film; instead, they push stereotypes to an extreme with a self-mocking attitude. At the same time, every major character shows a double-sidedness: a grandfather who once spoke only Cantonese suddenly raises a gun like a godfather; a seemingly gentle husband turns out to be a kung fu master; an overly anxious Chinese mother becomes the superhero who saves the world; even a caricatured white woman is softened by love into tenderness.",
      "Compared with *Everything Everywhere All at Once*, Pixar's *Turning Red* (released in 2022), though also set against the broader backdrop of Asian American life, feels more conventional in its handling of social phenomena like race or adolescent rebellion. The irreverence of *Everything Everywhere All at Once* helps it break the seriousness and caution of Western cinema's political-correctness discipline; at the same time, it also makes up for a habitual evasiveness in Chinese-language cinema when confronting sensitive social issues.",
      "Outside the film, the upbeat attitude of this group of Chinese diasporic actors in real life also breaks the suffering narrative that mainstream American society often pins onto minority groups. At this February's Screen Actors Guild Awards, James Hong, who plays the grandfather in *Everything Everywhere All at Once*, played on one of the film's running jokes. As soon as he stepped onstage, he spoke in Cantonese, leaving the American audience bewildered—and then immediately launched into fluent English, as if declaring: I can speak English; I simply choose not to. The room burst into laughter.",
      "Rather than using negative, cynical irony to evade or dilute the problem itself, the Daniels adopt a positive ironic stance to confront contradictions in social meaning and existential meaning. They attempt to reconcile with them sincerely—and to answer a question that has troubled countless poets, philosophers, and ordinary people over the past two centuries, and far longer: if nothing in the world matters, how should I live?",
      "However you answer, some people will choose to stick a third googly eye on their forehead, looking down upon this kaleidoscopic earthly life. And this is something more and more people are practicing in our metamodern age."

      "In April this year, *Sleep No More, Shanghai*—the Shanghai production of the immersive theatre work jointly created by the British theatre company Punchdrunk and SMG Live—welcomed its 1,600th resident performance in Shanghai. As the production's 2023 partner, Valentino joined forces with the *Sleep No More, Shanghai* team on April 11 to present a one-night-only commemorative performance. Titled ***The Box***, this immersive presentation featured performers dressed in looks from Valentino's Spring/Summer 2023 collection themed \\\"Unboxing Valentino.\\\" With an entirely new stage, narrative, and choreography, the performance offered audiences a visual feast in which bodies and garments merged as one.",
      "On April 13, T China interviewed **Conor Doyle**, director of *The Box*, via video. Doyle joined Punchdrunk 16 years ago and has since participated in the performance and production of *Sleep No More* in both Boston and New York. Seven years ago, he came to China as the choreographic director of *Sleep No More, Shanghai*. Throughout the interview, Doyle repeatedly emphasized that the spiritual core of *Sleep No More* lies in **\\\"Embrace the Unexpected.\\\"** The collaboration with Valentino, he noted, was precisely an exploration of the boundaries of the \\\"unknown\\\" within the limits of a box.",
      "Here is Doyle's narration.",
      "For Punchdrunk, arriving in Shanghai marked a major step in *Sleep No More*'s entry into the international market. Alongside our excitement, there was also a trace of anxiety: as an immersive theatre company that places extreme importance on audience experience, how could we \\\"convince\\\" unfamiliar Chinese audiences to open themselves up and fully surrender to us? Only after the McKinnon Hotel (the venue of *Sleep No More, Shanghai*) officially opened its doors did we realize that this concern was entirely unnecessary.",
      "Chinese audiences showed none of the shyness we had imagined. Whether in response to the form of *Sleep No More* or to the story of *Macbeth*, they displayed an intrinsic \\\"hunger.\\\" The company regarded this hunger as a gift from the audience and transformed it into momentum—we, too, longed to form a more intimate connection with them. Whether it was a fleeting exchange of eye contact, or a performer choosing one \\\"lucky\\\" masked ghost from among many and leading them by the hand into a sealed space, to enter *Sleep No More* is to step into another unknown world.",
      "Some audience members have described *Sleep No More* as a \\\"sexy\\\" piece of theatre, and I completely agree. I think the male witch I once played in the New York production was one of the sexiest characters in the entire show. We conducted extensive research on witch trials and discovered that in Scottish culture, one of the witch's most important functions was to attract and to seduce. Because *Sleep No More* contains almost no dialogue, we must translate the \\\"danger\\\" and \\\"seduction\\\" hidden in Shakespeare's *Macbeth* into bodily movement. As a choreographic director, dance does not necessarily point to a specific plot for me; dance is emotion, sensation, energy—it is also an instinct for existence.",
      "I have been with Punchdrunk for 16 years. During this time, the world has changed like an unstoppable beast, and it has never been an \\\"isolated place.\\\" *Sleep No More* has always evolved and iterated alongside the passage of time.",
      "The McKinnon Hotel in Shanghai blends Scottish elegance with the retro aesthetics of old Shanghai. But the changes Punchdrunk made go far beyond interior design. In the Shanghai production of *Sleep No More*, we incorporated figures from the Chinese folk legend *The Legend of the White Snake*, reimagining *Macbeth*, this classic British story, and infusing it with new vitality.",
      "For instance, the White Snake appears as the twin sister of one of the witches in *Macbeth*. As the narrative unfolds, audiences gradually learn more about the ambiguity and entanglement between the two. In the theatre world, not every company visiting a foreign land can localize its story naturally. Therefore, when Punchdrunk designs its narratives, we insist on introducing localized storylines while preserving the richness of the characters. Especially in immersive theatre, we do not want audiences merely to watch a character—we hope they can enter, peer into, and even touch the person behind the character.",
      "Today, various \\\"best routes for *Sleep No More*\\\" circulate online, as if fans want to plan everything in advance to ensure they \\\"get their money's worth.\\\" In reality, however, the creative team does not expect audiences to know anything about the show before stepping through the hotel doors. At least for me personally, the moment I enter the McKinnon Hotel and put on the mask, all the noise in my mind falls silent. I would rather listen to my inner perceptions and desires and wander freely through the hotel's spaces. Every audience member can become the director of this fantasy world. Before attending, one may read *Macbeth* to understand the basic storyline, or even watch a few films by suspense master Alfred Hitchcock to get a feel for *Sleep No More*'s style. Compared with meticulous planning, \\\"knowing nothing at all\\\" may be the ideal state for viewing the show—only then can one truly \\\"embrace the unexpected\\\" together with the *Sleep No More* team.",
      "As is well known, *Sleep No More* has a devoted group of regular audiences. To keep the production fresh for them, even with a demanding schedule of six performances a week, Punchdrunk continues to design new storylines, recruit new performers, and explore new forms of expression. The collaboration with Valentino, for *Sleep No More*, became an opportunity to expand the boundaries of the theatrical stage, as well as a challenge that pushed performers and directors alike to surpass themselves.",
      "Two months ago, *Sleep No More, Shanghai* officially began preparations for *The Box*, presented in collaboration with Valentino. Exquisite clothing functions as a tangible extension of a performer's personality. When the performers first put on the Unboxing Valentino Spring/Summer 2023 collection, each of them seemed to be \\\"electrocuted,\\\" undergoing a miraculous transformation. If the 2021 collaboration emphasized minimalist aesthetics, then two years later the brand brought a subversive visual impact to this special performance through vivid colors and rich sheen.",
      "During the creation process, we kept returning to the question of how to understand creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli's statement: **\\\"Unboxing bodies, unboxing personalities, unboxing heritages.\\\"** We decided to design the stage as a box, \\\"locking\\\" all the performers' emotions, desires, and passions inside it, so that tension could erupt instantly in this one-night-only performance. At its core, *Sleep No More* is defined by boundless creativity and exceptional production values—and Valentino undoubtedly embodies these qualities perfectly.",
      "In fact, what truly enabled these two aesthetic systems to intersect was the sense of mystery they share. We were not staging a fashion show on a theatre stage; rather, we were exploring the possibilities of fusion between the theatrical stage and the fashion runway. Fashion itself is mobile art, while theatre can release fashion's inner spirit. Valentino's garments, to a great extent, helped dancers enrich their personal expression and even guided them toward discovering an unknown self.",
      "When the *Sleep No More* performers first learned that they would be performing inside a cramped box, they were puzzled. The box itself had no entrances or exits; performers had to enter the \\\"stage\\\" through two holes in the floor at opposite corners of the box. Yet these performers, adept at working within uncertainty, quickly adapted to this unconventional form.",
      "Before the April 11 performance began, audiences gradually took their seats as a black box stood at the center of the stage. People circled it again and again, unsure of its true purpose. Only after we invited the audience to sit around the box did a beam of light suddenly illuminate the interior, falling on the dancer Martina. A collective \\\"wow\\\" rippled through the room as surprise spread across the audience's faces. That moment was deeply gratifying for the creative team—because we knew we had successfully \\\"hypnotized\\\" the audience and guided them into a fantastical world belonging exclusively to *Sleep No More* and Valentino.",
      "The performers inside the box could not see the audience. The surrounding mirrors reflected only their own images, turning the box into a theatrical arena. As the music surged and the lights pulsed, performers rose one by one from beneath the stage into the box. As a collective, they erupted like a volcano, yearning to break free from the box's constraints. During rehearsals, I asked them to \\\"go wild,\\\" and in the actual performance, they indeed revealed their wildest and most authentic selves to the audience.",
      "**\\\"Only within constraints can true freedom be found\\\"**—this is the shared understanding that *Sleep No More* and Valentino arrived at through their collaboration this year."

    content: [
      "In the five years of innovative education practice by \\\"Let Summer Be,\\\" the lack of arts education has never been the only issue we focus on. While working with rural children aged 7–12, we have witnessed school corporal punishment, campus bullying, sexual harassment, and the complete absence of sex education and related intervention mechanisms. We have also seen the negative impact of uneven short-video content on children's values, the challenges brought to children by the consolidation and closure of rural primary schools, and the excessive environmental consumption caused by tourism… These structural problems are not unfamiliar, yet the public attention they receive remains far too brief and scattered.",
      "The Let Summer Be Panel invites frontline educators and public welfare practitioners to use their on-site research and educational practices in rural areas as the starting point for discussion, extending into deeper confusions and reflections. In each session, we bring a long-ignored yet critically important topic back to the center of the conversation.",
      "The key term for the first Let Summer Be Panel is: rural sex education. During the 2025 summer arts education camp organized by \\\"Let Summer Be,\\\" one of our camp students—an 8-year-old girl—was sexually assaulted by a middle-aged or elderly man in the village. Several of her lower-grade female friends had known about it all along but unanimously chose not to tell any adults in the village, including her own parents. The reason was: \\\"If the parents find out, they'll beat her instead.\\\"",
      "This girl's story is not an isolated case. According to a report released by the Beijing Zhongyi Public Welfare Foundation (\\\"Girl Child Protection\\\" team), in the first 11 months of 2024, national procuratorates prosecuted 41,000 cases of sexual crimes against minors. Yet the cases that actually enter the judicial system and are included in statistics are merely the tip of the iceberg. In rural areas, such experiences are even more deeply buried under structural silence: the complete absence of sex education, everyday avoidance of sexual topics in conversation, the shadow of domestic violence, children's lack of channels for expression and help-seeking, and the absence of social support systems in rural regions.",
      "As public welfare educators, we began to reflect: if girls are assumed to be the primary (or even sole) audience for sex education, then the very meaning of sex education will be limited to a one-way logic of strengthening self-protection and external vigilance. Therefore, through this roundtable, we hope to re-discuss: who exactly should sex education be directed toward, and how should it be understood and practiced?",
      "Below is the content of our roundtable discussion.",
      "**Linyu:** Over these years of working in the mountains, among the three of you here, is there any incident related to sex education that has left a particularly deep impression on you to this day?",
      "**Tiange & Zhuo'er:** The one that impressed everyone the most is probably the same incident.",
      "In the mountain village where we are based, there is a deaf-mute elderly man in his sixties. Over the years of doing arts education, we have always known of his existence in the village; he has some intellectual disabilities, and villagers call him \\\"the mute.\\\" This summer, on a Sunday during our mountain summer camp, he came to our activity site on his own initiative, banging hard on the classroom windows and making a lot of noise. Because he recognized a few of our teachers, he kept gesturing, as if trying to say something to us. At first, we thought he needed help and enthusiastically responded with gestures.",
      "Within minutes, several female students from the summer camp ran over, anxiously whispering to us: \\\"Don't go near him. He sexually assaulted one of our girls before.\\\" That little girl is 8 years old this year, looks thin and small, and her clothes are quite worn. According to the girls' account, the incident happened less than a year ago: the mute pulled her into a room at her home and assaulted her.",
      "This is not an isolated case. Several girls told us that this mute had tried to lure many children with small change in his hand and had also behaved with \\\"overly enthusiastic\\\" harassment toward young women in the village. There is another \\\"mute\\\" in the village, and girls reported that he had also made sexually harassing gestures: facing a girl, he would extend his index and middle fingers with one hand, make a circle with the other, and then insert the two fingers into the circle.",
      "Additionally, two preschool-aged little girls who are often left unsupervised clearly told us they were afraid of the mute because \\\"he pulled down their pants.\\\"",
      "**Linyu:** Regarding the sexual assault of the child, before the \\\"Let Summer Be\\\" teachers arrived, no adults in the village knew about it. It was only because the mute broke into the teaching site, the children showed abnormal reactions, and you asked further that they revealed it?",
      "**Zhuo'er:** Yes, that 8-year-old girl was particularly brave. She and her close friends had actually talked about it among themselves long ago and kept the secret together, never telling any adults.",
      "**Linyu:** Why didn't they want adults to know?",
      "**Tiange:** The main reason is fear of being beaten. The 8-year-old girl said that if her father found out, he would beat her to death. Her father is notorious in the village for domestic violence—he beats both the children and his wife, and has a very bad reputation. The children explicitly said, \\\"We don't want you to tell the adults; if the adults know, it will only bring them trouble.\\\" There is also social pressure. Another girl who had been subjected to obscene gestures by the second mute only dared to quietly tell me and her older sister (a high school student), insisting we not tell her mother. She said, \\\"Absolutely do not tell anyone at home.\\\"",
      "**Linyu:** In developmental psychology, there is a concept called \\\"parentification\\\" of children, meaning that when parents fail to fulfill their adult responsibilities, children are forced to take on adult roles. In this case, the children vaguely understood that telling adults would be useless or might even cause secondary harm. So they chose to internalize all the pain themselves. It's heartbreaking. And this is not an isolated case—we hear similar stories every year. There is simply no mechanism in the area for \\\"if you are violated, who can you turn to for help.\\\" On the contrary, speaking out would permanently label you as a victim, and that label is absolutely derogatory.",
      "After we learned about this, what was the initial reaction within the \\\"Let Summer Be\\\" team? Did you consider any responses? What did you end up doing?",
      "**Tiange:** My personal first reaction was extreme disgust. Just moments before, we had been smiling and communicating with him—he was drawing on paper, and several teachers, including me, were kindly trying to interpret his drawings. Learning the truth afterward was truly upsetting. Although he is in his sixties, hunched over, and poses no threat to us, the sense of insecurity was still very strong. (Note: The \\\"Let Summer Be\\\" team this year consisted entirely of female teachers.)",
      "We immediately drove him out of the school grounds and began discussing two things: first, to add sex education content to the curriculum; second, whether to tell the local person in charge. At first, we even probed his attitude: \\\"Have there been any cases of children being violated in the village?\\\" He answered very bluntly: \\\"No.\\\"",
      "Later, we told the person in charge the details but withheld the child's information. He verbally expressed great concern and said he would handle it. Although he sent the village joint defense team to investigate (by tracking the mute's movements to see if he would repeat inappropriate behavior) and claimed police would be involved later, when Xue Ding'e and I returned in November, we found the matter had been dropped. The mute was still wandering around the village as usual. The person in charge said that testimony from minors doesn't count and that an adult from the family needed to come forward. But to protect the child from potential domestic violence, we couldn't inform her parents without her consent, so no adult could testify. No one admitted the incident had occurred. In the end, nothing changed.",
      "In the village, there is a thick information barrier between children and adults. Almost all the girls—whether in school or dropped out—know this mute is dangerous. If you casually ask any little girl, they will say \\\"he will hurt people.\\\" But adults either pretend not to know or downplay it by saying \\\"he's just a bit odd.\\\" When we reported it to the person in charge, they showed none of the shock or anger we had imagined.",
      "**Linyu:** When you returned in November, had the police been involved at all?",
      "**Tiange & Xue Ding'e:** Not at all. At most, it reached the township joint defense team level; the police never came once.",
      "**Linyu:** It was also this incident that made me realize there is no police station within dozens of kilometers in the mountain area. When we mentioned it to the person in charge in person in August, he said the police station in the neighboring township is half an hour's drive away, but police are on call. During the summer camp, we had intended to report it to the police but were dissuaded by the person in charge: if we called now, it would cause too much commotion and expose the child to the whole village's gaze. We originally planned to report after the camp ended, but in the end, neither we nor the local person in charge actually did.",
      "**Zhuo'er:** Villagers actually took the matter seriously, but in front of us, they once seriously suggested \\\"finding a wife for this mute to satisfy his needs,\\\" hoping that would reduce such behavior. I still can't understand this to this day—is it some lingering traditional belief, or another logic altogether? It remains a big question mark for me.",
      "**Xue Ding'e:** Regarding \\\"finding a wife for the mute,\\\" I want to add broader context. The underlying logic in many Chinese rural areas today still views \\\"old bachelors\\\" as unstable elements threatening social stability. The simplest risk-avoidance method is to turn a public problem into a family one. From the real-life Xuzhou chained woman case to Jia Pingwa's novel *Qihua* (*Extreme Flowers*), the subsequent public discussions all reflect the same thinking: a bachelor can't stay single forever, so buy him a wife.",
      "This logic hasn't changed to this day.",
      "**Linyu:** Another noteworthy detail is that the person in charge could say, in front of an all-female teacher team, without any hesitation, \\\"To meet his needs, find him a wife,\\\" and not feel there was anything wrong with it.",
      "I don't think it's low emotional intelligence; rather, it inadvertently reveals a cruel categorization of women: which women can be bought as \\\"tools\\\"? In the speaker's mind, women are divided into different classes. And we outsider female teachers perhaps don't fall into the \\\"buyable\\\" category, so they had no qualms saying such things to us. Especially since this village is on the border, where trafficking of Myanmar brides is already common, they have tacitly accepted the \\\"tradability\\\" of certain types of women.",
      "**Tiange:** Yes, we asked locals whether buying a Myanmar bride counts as human trafficking, and they very matter-of-factly said, \\\"It's voluntary, it doesn't count as trafficking.\\\" But in reality, the man pays money, the woman is sent over without even meeting him, and many are only 14 when married to middle-aged men. They themselves don't admit it's trafficking; everyone just understands tacitly. They really don't see us as the same category as those \\\"women who can be bought.\\\"",
      "**Linyu:** I also want to add one detail: after learning about it, the teachers actually kept the children's secret for several days. They initially made us pinky-swear \\\"not to tell any adults in the village.\\\" Those few days, we were extremely tense internally, debating whether to strictly keep the promise to the children to protect their privacy and mental health, or as mandatory reporters aware of a criminal case, we had to report it. In the end, we chose to seek help from the village in the most low-key way possible while protecting the child's privacy. This is a dilemma many rural public welfare workers face—I heard similar stories frequently in earlier years working with other teaching organizations.",
      "Beyond the cases just mentioned, over the past few years, have you observed other worrying examples related to local children's gender awareness or sexual behavior? What about the boys?",
      "**Xue Ding'e:** First, an objective limitation: those who come to participate in arts education are almost all girls; boys are far fewer. Although boys have attended over the years, their mental state is more detached—they often leave class midway, and opportunities for deep communication with them are much fewer than with girls.",
      "**Linyu:** Then let me add a few examples from previous years. In 2023, when we first started the qualitative research and conducted many in-depth interviews, two little girls casually mentioned an incident that recently happened in a village near Dali: a boy splashed sulfuric acid directly onto a girl's genitals. Almost all the village children knew about it, but not from adults. They have their own information circulation channels among themselves, and we still haven't fully figured out how it spreads.",
      "Another incident closer to us happened in spring 2023. We were planning to return the following year for arts education when the person in charge suddenly messaged me on WeChat to \\\"be careful.\\\" I asked what to watch out for, and he replied \\\"puppy love issues,\\\" then immediately withdrew the message. I found it strange—how did puppy love become a safety issue? Only when we arrived in the village did we accidentally learn the truth from children. A logistics teacher in the village drove several little girls to and from school every day. In casual chat, I asked one girl if she had siblings; she smiled and said, \\\"I have an older brother who's already in prison.\\\" Further questioning revealed that her brother and another older boy had robbed and sexually assaulted a younger girl on the way home from school.",
      "The final outcome: the victim girl dropped out of school; the two perpetrator boys went to juvenile detention; the local primary school principal was removed. The new principal set a bizarre rule: because of the sexual assault incident, girls were no longer allowed to wear skirts to school and had to wear pants.",
      "It's been almost three years, and I haven't confirmed with the children whether the rule was later lifted. But this incident shocked me deeply: although the case was \\\"handled\\\" with legal and police involvement, the entire response approach was regressive—not teaching children how to protect themselves, not holding perpetrators accountable, but using more conservative, controlling measures on girls to \\\"solve the problem.\\\" It's as if sex education isn't neglected but deliberately avoided.",
      "These incidents made us reflect: although the arts education we do can help children discover beauty and relieve psychological pressure, faced with the severe consequences of the lack of sex education, can and should we intervene? In 2023, we only made a very small attempt in drama class—an improv workshop on \\\"learning to say no,\\\" having children perform in groups \\\"what to do if someone bullies me.\\\" But because we weren't professionals and feared directly discussing \\\"sex\\\" would lead to uncontrollable consequences, that class didn't mention sexual assault or body boundaries at all, only vaguely talking about mental health and personal safety. It wasn't until this year's incident in 2025 that I truly realized: sex education is something we cannot avoid or delay.",
      "Zhuo'er, you led a formal sex education class this year—can you talk about your design thinking and personal journey?",
      "**Zhuo'er:** From the start, I was clear: in this village, for children this age, what they lack most is \\\"recognizing threats\\\" and \\\"protecting themselves.\\\" The core was to help them identify which behaviors constitute threats and how to refuse and seek help.",
      "Before this full-participation sex education class, I partnered with teacher Xinpei to offer a small-scale sex education session in our class \\\"Me and Our Ideal Life.\\\" She has participated in this teaching project for many years and also noticed the village's lack of child sex education. Before conducting the formal class, I refined the course design based on the rhythm of our small classes and my living experience in the village. Since my contact time with them was short—only two weeks—I adopted a gradual approach, encouraging more participation: first building awareness, then teaching specific methods. Girls made up the vast majority in class; there was only one boy. The girls actually already had some awareness and could respond positively to the cases we presented. But one detail struck me: when we had a teacher demonstrate \\\"if the worst has already happened, what is your first step,\\\" many children answered \\\"call the police\\\" or \\\"tell a friend,\\\" but no one first said \\\"immediately get away from the person harming you.\\\" They hadn't realized this at all before.",
      "So, if there's another opportunity in the future, we can focus more on building instinctive reactions and help-seeking awareness rather than staying at the knowledge level. Adults deliberately avoid the topic, but children actually know among themselves—just vaguely. What they lack isn't information, but the sense of security that \\\"adults are here supporting them to speak out.\\\"",
      "**Linyu:** This reminds me of a deeper question: in the end, almost only girls remain in our arts education camp, and nearly all attendees of the sex education class are girls. If we temporarily fix the identities as girls = potential victims, boys = potential perpetrators, then the sex education we're doing now is only teaching victims how to protect themselves, without touching potential perpetrators at all—not telling boys \\\"why you cannot harm others\\\" or \\\"how to control yourself.\\\" Many sex education programs on the market end up becoming \\\"classes only for girls,\\\" resulting in girls becoming more vigilant and paranoid (I'm like that myself), while boys remain unchanged. Girls' sense of safety hasn't truly increased because of more sex education.",
      "Going further: in such a tight-knit small village, is sex education only for minors enough? Clearly not. If adults in the village had healthier views on sex and gender, even if a little girl never attended a sex education class, she would have more courage to speak out when something happens, because she knows people around her would stand by her. So I increasingly feel that true sex education should target the entire community, not just potential victims.",
      "**Tiange:** This year, during that sex education class, I noticed a particularly contradictory phenomenon: the few little girls we most wanted to help raise self-protection awareness were distracted the whole time and even walked out of the classroom in the end. They were either afraid to face the topic or simply didn't listen well usually. Instead, the ones who listened seriously and actively participated were children from supposedly better family backgrounds with more open-minded parents—precisely the group at lower risk, because their parents have stronger protective awareness and usually pick them up and drop them off. Children from poorer families often run around the village alone, facing higher exposure to danger. This gave me a big headache.",
      "**Zhuo'er:** Yes, within their small children's circle, they can already identify \\\"who is a bad person\\\" and know to stay away. But once adults explain it away as \\\"he's just a bit odd,\\\" they don't know how to connect \\\"odd\\\" with \\\"dangerous.\\\" More crucially, they dare not face the topic—even if we teach lightly and try not to hit sore spots, they still avoid it.",
      "**Tiange:** When describing it to us, those girls could directly use the term \\\"sexual assault\\\" without any euphemism, showing they have that awareness. But for reasons we adults can't feel, they strongly resist discussing it systematically.",
      "**Linyu:** Finally, one last question: if we take our practical experience in the mountains and compare it horizontally to our own upbringing, do you think the root cause of these cases is backward economy, education, or geography? Or is sex education still far from adequate even in resource-rich places? None of us grew up in such remote areas, yet similar things happened around us too. In other words, did the sex education we received really make us safer?",
      "**Tiange:** I think sex education in cities is actually very complex, varying greatly by family. Take me for example—my family was quite conservative, I was always the good girl, and the little physiology knowledge taught in school wasn't very useful. 95% of the truly useful sex knowledge I learned came from actively searching online as an adult—reliable science popularizers, soft articles, etc. Rural children now also use Kuaishou and Douyin, but the algorithms aren't friendly to them; their feeds are full of vulgar, suggestive, or worse content, with almost no access to truly quality sex education resources. Schools occasionally teach basic physiology and hygiene, but that's it. The remaining barriers are too many.",
      "**Xue Ding'e & Tiange:** In November, we also discovered that some older girls in the village (junior or senior high) posted very suggestive videos on Kuaishou. For example, a 16–18-year-old girl lying in bed with a blindfold, a belt around her neck, with strongly sexual implications in the text and pose. Another girl, actually only 8 but severely malnourished and looking like 6, wearing a low-cut dress, deliberately exposing her chest low, mimicking adult women's seductive expressions. This far exceeds the sexual awareness appropriate for their age.",
      "**Linyu:** My own experience was primary school in Beijing—the school did offer sex education classes, fairly formal—but that content never truly entered my consciousness. The first time I encountered danger as an adult, I couldn't recall anything taught in those classes or mobilize it to protect myself. Later reflecting, I realized I had a big problem: I naturally trusted everyone. Even when someone showed obvious malice, I subconsciously thought \\\"he wouldn't do anything to me.\\\" That trust actually left me in passive danger many times.",
      "So now I'm a bit doubtful: how useful is sex education really? At least for me, before personally experiencing it, no matter how many classes there were, it seemed just \\\"knowing\\\" rather than \\\"being able to apply.\\\"",
      "The \\\"Girl Child Protection\\\" team believes: \\\"The increase in reported sexual assaults on urban children shows that urban children receive more intensive attention from family, society, and media. Influenced by factors like public awareness, judicial perfection, and media development, sexual assault cases against rural children are harder to detect, harder to enter judicial procedures, and harder to be exposed by media.\\\"",
      "**Xue Ding'e:** Why do I feel like I never received any sex education as a child?",
      "**Zhuo'er:** Yes! Thinking back, in upper primary school at most we had separate physiology and hygiene classes—girls learned about periods and hygiene, boys probably wet dreams. Words like sexual assault, boundaries, consent never appeared once.",
      "**Xue Ding'e:** In my small town in Anhui too—the homeroom teacher kicked all the boys out and gave the girls half a period on physiology and hygiene, that's all.",
      "**Tiange:** Similar in the Pearl River Delta. In junior high, one teacher demonstrated condom use with a wooden stick once, but that was it. Real knowledge about sexual assault and consent basically all came from searching online myself.",
      "**Zhuo'er:** In my public school in Dalian, from primary to junior high, there was no proper sex education. The only faint memory is the school forcing us to buy a \\\"Safety Education\\\" textbook with comics on \\\"how to prevent abduction and sexual assault,\\\" but teachers never taught it. As a child, I loved flipping through it because of the comics, so I read it myself and accidentally gained some awareness. The first real demonstration with a banana and condom was in senior year after transferring to an international school, taught by a foreign teacher in life planning class. That was no longer mainstream Chinese education.",
      "**Linyu:** I later attended so-called sex education classes in international school too—it was just the teacher randomly playing a video found online; as soon as the class saw it wasn't exam material, they started making noise, and no one listened. The teacher didn't care, played the video, then started reciting poetry to the air… That class ended up with just me and the teacher discussing poetry.",
      "**Zhuo'er:** Haha, my high school was an old campus with gender-separated schools—all girls in class. Because many students transferred from Chinese public schools, meaning sex education was also absent before entering the international curriculum. Everyone tended to think, \\\"Wow, the school actually teaches this,\\\" so they went with a spectator mindset, and attention was unexpectedly focused—another accidental success.",
      "**Linyu:** So the four of our upbringing backgrounds—Beijing, Pearl River Delta, Dalian, small town in Anhui—already cover quite a range of regions and economic conditions, yet the conclusion is strikingly consistent: sex education in mainstream Chinese schools is basically absent or superficial. Truly useful knowledge almost all comes from self-supplementing online as adults. The problem in mountain areas may not be solely due to poverty or remoteness, but rather that in places with scarcer resources and thicker information barriers, the impact is more severe yet less visible.",
      "The children remain innocent still. Several little girls wrapped triangle plums with homework paper copied with Tang poem \\\"Spring Dawn\\\" and gave them to the teachers. \\\"Sounds of wind and rain at night—how many flowers have fallen?\\\" Placed in the context of this roundtable, it perhaps adds another layer of cruel metaphorical meaning."

      "True randomness is difficult to achieve in code. Computers are deterministic machines; they follow instructions. To create serendipity, we must introduce noise—external data, weather patterns, or the decay of a radioactive isotope. We must inject the physical world into the digital logic.",
      "When a music recommendation engine serves us a song we didn't know we needed, is it calculation or fate? The line blurs. The algorithm understands our patterns better than we do ourselves, finding connections in the data that our conscious minds miss.",
      "Perhaps serendipity is not about true randomness, but about the delight of the unexpected connection. In that sense, the machine can be a poet, weaving together disparate threads of information into a tapestry that feels, against all odds, like destiny."

      "Brutalism is often misunderstood as cold or harsh. Yet, there is a profound softness to be found in the raw concrete, a velvety texture that absorbs light rather than reflecting it. It is a style of honesty, exposing the materials for what they are.",
      "When we introduce organic elements—greenery, wood, or textiles—to a brutalist structure, a dialogue begins. The steel frames the velvet; the concrete holds the vine. It is the interplay of opposites that creates the aesthetic tension.",
      "Living in these spaces feels like inhabiting a sculpture. The massive forms provide a sense of protection, a fortress against the chaos of the outside world. Within these grey walls, the colors of life pop with greater intensity.",
      "To appreciate brutalism is to look past the surface grimness and see the structural integrity. It is to find beauty in strength, and comfort in the unyielding permanence of stone and steel."
