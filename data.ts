    title: 'Education Is Not Sisyphus\'s Boulder',
    subtitle: 'A "Bottom-Up" Experiment in Rural Arts Education',

      "One of the key breakthroughs in China's rural revitalization strategy lies in advancing arts education at the level of basic rural schooling—promoting educational equity between urban and rural areas while strengthening rural cultural governance. Every summer, the art co-creation platform Let Summer Be invites talented and socially engaged young artists to reside in rural schools across China. By transforming artists into teaching artists, the program uses collaborative art-making to cultivate children's enthusiasm for knowledge and for life itself in mountainous regions.",
      "Recently, the documentary Paradise, How Far?, directed by Yuan Jinxin, was shortlisted for New Weekly's 'Hot Sound' Nonfiction Short Film Award. The film documents Let Summer Be's rural arts-education practice in 2022. Compared with traditional public-interest short films, Paradise, How Far? adopts an observational perspective that focuses on the meeting of two experiential worlds—from the hidden pain embedded in the growth of left-behind children in mountainous areas to the multiple constraints shaping the survival and development of marginal rural communities. Individuals, families, villages, and regions gradually connect from isolated points into visible lines, while a young grassroots arts-education collective reflects, through practice, on the boundaries of action and the directions forward. In this week's retrospective, we begin with the documentary and invite participants to share the thinking behind their work.",
      "In the summer of 2022, just before departure, documentary director Yuan Jinxin asked me, 'Do you want this to be a promotional film for Let Summer Be, or a work of my own observation and reflection?' I answered without hesitation: the latter. Paradise, How Far? honestly records the dilemmas a grassroots organization encounters while working in mountainous regions.",
      "In August 2023, Paradise, How Far? reached its tenth screening—this time for the very children who appeared in the film. Their villages were scattered across a ten-kilometer radius, and parents rode motorcycles to bring their children to an outdoor basketball court for the screening. Due to a projector malfunction, dozens of children ultimately gathered around a single 13-inch laptop and watched the entire film attentively. Many said it was the first screening they had ever attended.",
      "As with screenings held in urban cultural spaces, we held a post-screening discussion with the children and their parents. Unlike urban audiences, they did not raise questions shaped by social-science critique. As the filmed subjects themselves, their responses were simple and direct: 'Did you like seeing yourself from last year?' 'Yes!' 'Do you want us to come back every year to make documentaries?' 'Yes!' For arts-education practitioners, these brief exchanges were deeply significant.",
      "Increasingly, social scientists have begun to recognize the risk that 'mutual visibility' in fieldwork or action-based research can slip into one-sided gazes. The same applies to public-interest work. When engaging with those one seeks to support, the posture of action requires constant reflection and care. Yet fear of imposing one's gaze should not become a reason to abandon action altogether.",
      "Geographic mobility alone does not dissolve the cultural barriers between urban and rural life. By the second quarter of 2023, Yunnan Province had over 6.7 million rural migrant workers employed outside their home regions. Beyond tourist imagery, the daily lives of multiethnic rural communities remain largely unknown. Even amid an overflow of short-form video content, people remain confined within their own information bubbles.",
      "In 2021, due to the pandemic, I was unable to return to school and, by chance, became a semester-long mathematics teacher at a rural elementary school near the China–Myanmar border in Yunnan. There, I witnessed firsthand the realities of mountain schools: severe structural shortages of teachers, performative administrative management, the absence of school nurses, imbalanced curricula, high dropout rates in middle school, and persistent school bullying. These were never merely educational problems. The same educational policies and resources, when applied to different families, produced vastly different outcomes.",
      "In public discourse, 'arts education' is often equated with art instruction and easily misunderstood as a one-way transmission of artists' ideas to rural children. In practice, however, meaningful arts education gently confronts urgent social and educational issues. Before designing any curriculum, the team conducts semi-structured interviews, examining four developmental dimensions: students' interests and hobbies; personality traits and mental health; social behavior; and external environments, particularly educational practices within schools and families, as well as broader policy contexts. These insights inform both course structure and teaching methods.",
      "During one interview, we visited the home of a sixth-grade girl, Xiaopeng. The walls were covered with academic award certificates earned by her and her younger brother during primary school. Yet Xiaopeng's outward demeanor did not align with urban expectations of a 'model student.' She explained that at school, she and her classmates were all in a state of 'going dark,' because teachers were extremely harsh. Homework was overwhelming, and corporal punishment was common.",
      "'Going dark' was a term the students invented to describe sudden, exaggerated, almost manic performances without clear cause. Only after leaving school did they stop 'going dark.' It was a form of black humor learned unconsciously among peers.",
      "Educational challenges did not end at the school gate. For children born after 2010, short-video apps function much like QQ or WeChat did for earlier generations—as social platforms. At the same time, they circulate large volumes of adult and violent content. Children lack the ability to discern such information, while parents and teachers often lack awareness or intervention strategies. In daily debriefs conducted by Let Summer Be's anthropology research team, many children reported being victims of school bullying and choosing silence most of the time.",
      "After discussion, we decided to create a drama workshop centered on practicing how to say 'no.' Through role-play, drama teachers and students jointly imagined potential crisis scenarios from daily life, encouraging children to assert boundaries and speak up against behaviors that made them uncomfortable.",
      "Educational practice is always deeply grounded in reality, especially in culturally diverse mountain villages. As outside practitioners, negotiating a shared understanding of arts education with local stakeholders—students, parents, and village committees—is essential to ensuring feasibility and effectiveness.",
      "Most local communities warmly welcome volunteer teachers, but a small number of parents or village officials may not fully understand or support such initiatives. In previous years, some parents even tore up their children's artwork, criticizing them for 'scribbling instead of studying Chinese and math.' We realized that limiting arts education to collaboration with children alone could unintentionally deepen rifts between children and their families or surroundings.",
      "As a result, we launched community-based art projects that invited other community members to witness outcomes and participate. In 2022, for example, clown parade designer Alice led children from the clown workshop to don red noses and walk through markets, along the Nu River, and into the mountains, playing games with villagers. Seeing familiar children reappear as clowns—speaking in their own voices and doing what they found joyful—villagers experienced a kind of re-recognition. The red nose became a small magic wand, allowing everyone to meet one another anew.",
      "On the day of the final course presentation in 2023, the local basketball team unexpectedly needed the performance space. Worried about occupying a public area, we urged one another to wrap up quickly. Yet halfway through the performance, a village leader surprised us by saying, 'It's fine—go on. We'll wait.' Members of the basketball team stopped to watch attentively. After so many earlier obstacles, this moment felt profoundly affirming.",
      "A recurring question we face is whether a single summer can truly make a difference. This is also a form of self-critique among organizers who run arts-education programs in their spare time: how do we avoid becoming experience-driven, pop-up summer camps?",
      "China has no shortage of teaching-support programs—undergraduates seeking credits, study-abroad agencies enhancing student profiles, urban–rural exchange initiatives. These efforts represent difficult first steps; offering mutual recognition is always meaningful. Yet we choose summer not for convenience, but because we recognize that semester-based instruction allows little freedom for action. Volunteers' values often diverge from quantitative metrics imposed by education authorities. More importantly, we refuse to arrive like meteors and leave just as quickly. We aim instead to build long-term trust and cooperation with local communities, accompanying children's growth through sustained, year-by-year engagement."

    subtitle: '—The Repressed Lyricism of Paradise, How Far?',
    excerpt: 'An analysis of documentary filmmaking as bearing witness through the metaphor of a parrot.',

      "In my view, Chen Jiaping's documentary Paradise, How Far? is grounded in a parrot-like mode of lyricism—being present, watching, recording, and reproducing.",
      "On October 30, 2022, director Gu Tao hosted a screening of Paradise, How Far?",
      "A parrot is an animal that spends its entire life mimicking human speech, yet can never truly express emotion through language. Its body becomes an objective vessel, storing the sounds it hears in an inner chamber of memory. While the people in a household move steadily toward tomorrow, the parrot, often inadvertently, begins to recite voices from yesterday—voices long forgotten. Within four walls, echoes of the past linger, reverberating until the parrot's death.",
      "In my view, Paradise, How Far? is built upon precisely this kind of parrot-like lyricism: presence, observation, recording, reenactment. Chen Jiaping, though a direct participant in all that unfolds, presents himself only through the silence of a bystander. Upon this carefully constructed silence arise other sounds: the grief-stricken singing at poet Hu Xudong's funeral; the choked speech at his friend Kun Niao's wedding; his wife's relentless reproaches in a car at midnight; the anxious counsel of his aging father. Like all poets, Chen Jiaping longs for 'the stillness of the open wilderness,' yet he understands all too clearly that 'his life is not a life lived alone.' His life is the sum of the lives of those he loves. Within this helpless yet tender cacophony, he chooses to become an 'unfeeling' parrot—silently remembering an affectionate life. And yet, this does not prevent him, beyond the parrot's narration, from yearning for a voice that is truly his own: the poet's voice.",
      "At the beginning of the film, Chen Jiaping washes up in a bathroom. A broadcast commemorating the centenary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party blends seamlessly with the sound of running water—an utterly mundane fusion, yet one that inevitably produces an inner dissonance. The broadcast serves as a conduit for an official, grand narrative, diffusing a set of words entirely detached from everyday life into its smallest details. Against this generational background noise, Chen Jiaping opens the tap, allowing the ordinary, flowing moments of life of poets born in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s to surface before the audience.",
      "Throughout the film, Chen Jiaping places himself deliberately low within the crowd. He admits that his interactions with poets such as Ma Yan (1979–2010) and Ma Hua (1972–2004) were not particularly close—merely sharing the same office air. Yet he preserves, intact in memory, that shared breath, carrying it across time to present it once more to the viewer. We are fortunate to see archival footage of Ma Yan speaking while alive. But this nested cinematography constantly reminds us that the poet's image has already been sealed into historical record. Even more poignant is the moment when the camera turns to poet Hu Xudong (1974–2021): the director draws us back into a first-person perspective, listening to a young 'Hu Zi' passionately analyzing Ma Yan's poetic structure in Chongqing dialect, as though he were still here before us, speaking to us directly.",
      "If mourning the dead is painful, then what is even more desolate is watching the dead mourn the dead from the vantage point of the future. At Ma Yan's funeral, Hu Xudong asked friends from all walks of life to write postcards—Ma Yan's favorite—for her. Yet in August 2021, Hu Xudong himself died suddenly from an epileptic seizure, and we found ourselves again at a funeral, singing him farewell: 'Weiming Lake is an ocean / Poets hide beneath its surface / Souls are all fish / Rising now and then to the light'",
      "Poets—though you have already journeyed to a more beautiful paradise, why do I still feel that you remain among us? Perhaps you are only hidden beneath the water's surface. Your undying poetry tethers your undying souls, surging again and again into our lives, into our hearts.",
      "On the other side of the screen, I could barely hold back my tears. Chen Jiaping, however, stood apart from the crowd, gazing at the camera in silence. To continue filming even during mourning should not be hastily interpreted as emotional detachment. Chen is pursuing a form of witnessing and participation imbued with historical weight. The cost is an objective lens that forever stands between him and what he sees. Such a commitment to remembrance and responsibility is, for an ordinary person immersed in grief, both heavy and cruel. Thus, beyond public mourning, he also seeks out narrow corners in which to retreat into private reflection and emotion. As the car disappears into a stormy night, his emotions surge quietly beneath the music.",
      "At the wedding of Kun Niao, a poet born in the 1980s, I saw him awkwardly encased in a suit. Half-jokingly, he commanded the audience: 'You must bless me—I have no choice.' Why must there be blessings? Why is there no choice? His speech did not celebrate a shared love, but reaffirmed the predicament of an individual. The absence of family weighed heavily on him; family, it seemed, were the roots of life, while friends were gifts gathered during the body's wandering. 'I'm already very satisfied—I've done everything I wanted to do,' he said. For many, a wedding signifies less the beginning of a new life than the ritualized end of an old one. He had once 'lived in this place in a way that was out of tune'—would marriage bring that dissonance to an end? As he stepped into this sacred space, the wind swept across his hair, covering one eye; the other reddened. The poet cried, without leaning toward the bride.",
      "Chen Jiaping once had an accident while filming as he drove. Later, his wife reproached him for filming, while he remained silent, eyes fixed on the camera. Between cinéma vérité and direct cinema, Chen chooses the former, acknowledging that in certain moments he amplifies the camera's presence, using its burden as a means to further dissect reality. In the scene of his wife's reproach, the camera's presence honestly reflects the power dynamics between husband and wife in that moment—he is always listening, always watching.",
      "City neon lights wash over Chen's face; fireworks burst overhead; from above, an empty lot appears—nearly desolate. Along an endless coastline, from below, a full moon rises—distant yet bright. Carrying all his memories, he returns to his 'cell,' only now without an 'iris' to carry him aloft.",
      "Yes—the parrot has died. The parrot that participated alongside Chen Jiaping throughout the film died in the middle of the night. But I believe that the poet Chen Jiaping still holds onto the ideal of the 'iris,' only buried deeper. In the black frames at the beginning and end of the film, the poet discards the parrot-like images of record. What remains is only his poetic monologue, spoken in his native accent. Poetry may be the only way, under the arrangements of our time, for us to arrive at 'a life of one's own.'",
      "I do not know what the parrot's death ultimately signifies for Chen Jiaping. I only see that as his wife and daughter weep, Chen once again takes out his phone. Perhaps he understands better than anyone that mourning is everywhere, permeating every night of life. We will all eventually fall asleep in the dark of mourning, tears still wet—and when you wake—dawn is still smiling.",
